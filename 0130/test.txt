Kate, the Princess of Wales, has been discharged from the hospital after undergoing a "planned abdominal surgery," according to Kensington Palace.

"The Princess of Wales has returned home to Windsor to continue her recovery from surgery. She is making good progress," a Kensington Palace spokesperson said Monday. "The Prince and Princess wish to say a huge thank you to the entire team at The London Clinic, especially the dedicated nursing staff, for the care they have provided."

The spokesperson added, "The Wales family continues to be grateful for the well wishes they have received from around the world."

Kate, 42, was admitted to The London Clinic earlier this month for the surgery, which the palace described as "successful."

The palace did not provide further details on the type of surgery Kate underwent on Jan. 16, but confirmed to ABC News that the princess's medical issue is non-cancerous.
